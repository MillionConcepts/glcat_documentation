## Hotspots and Coldspots: Detector Artifacts 

Two artifacts that consistently appears in GALEX images regardless of observation type or duration are "hotspots" and "coldspots". Hotspots have very high count rates and generally occur in the same locations on the detector in most eclipses. Coldspots are similar to hotspots visually, but have very low count rates (~0 cps) even over long eclipses. Both coldspots and hotspots are important to identify for accurate photometric measurements, but hotspots have the added risk of possibly being identified as stars. 

The GALEX mission team drew masks [how did they do this again? p sure they're hand drawn tbh] to cover common hotspots on the NUV and FUV detectors. These masks (`NUV_mask.fits` and `FUV_mask.fits` in the `cal_data` folder of gPhoton2) are still used in gPhoton2 to mask reoccuring, bright hotspots on both detectors. The mission mask is applied to the photons during gPhoton2 processing, and the hotspot flag generated by that mask is accessible in the [Flag Map as Flag 1](../Image File Formats.md## Flag Maps). However, some hotspots are transient and therefore not covered by the mission-generated hotspot mask. These un-masked hotspots could be mistakenly identified as stars during source-finding and require an additional quality metric to identify them. 

### A Novel Metric for Identifying Hotspots (SIGDISP)

Detector artifacts and stars have one very useful difference: their shape in sky-projected images and detector-coordinate images. Because the telescope spiraled around the target FOV in a dither pattern, photons from the sky were collected on the detector in a pattern matching the telescope motion. Meanwhile, hotspots had a constant location on the detector during an observation. When the observation is then projected to the sky, the opposite pattern appears and hotspot tracks are shaped like the dither pattern while stars are condensed to points.

We can visualize what this pattern would look like at the photon level. In the example below, photons from stars appear tightly clustered in sky-projected (RA/DEC) space, whereas photons from a hotspot trace a spiral in that same space. In detector space, the pattern is reversed.

To capture the difference between on-detector and sky-projected patterns, gPhoton2 calculates a metric we call "dispersion" for the photons in each bin (pixel) of the sky-projected backplanes. Two images are generated: the standard deviation of binned photon's detector row values and  the standard deviation of binned photon's detector column values. The "dispersion" metric is the sum of these two images. 

` dispersion = std(photon detector row values in sky-projected space) + std(photon detector column values in sky-projected space) `

Because hotspots are highly localized in detector space, we expect them to have lower dispersion values. Conversely, stars should have higher dispersion values, albeit constrained by the dither pattern of the eclipse.

The dispersion image is not written as an output to gPhoton2. Instead, aperture photometry is run on the dispersion image. The results are normalized to the size of the aperture (`aperture sum / area of aperture`) and written to the column `stdcolrow_aperture_sum` in the photometry tables, or `BAND_SIGDISP_APER[ix]` in the band catalog files. Dispersion values range between eclipses based on the dither pattern, but as a rule very low values are likely hotspots or other detector-originating artifacts. Smaller aperture sizes are more useful for identifying hotspots and stars as there is less background contamination. 

### Other Applications of Dispersion 

Beyond the scope of the gPhoton2, count rate and dispersion can be useful for identifying all different parts of the backplanes. In the below example, dispersion and count are plotted against each other and matched to locations in a dose map. Note that dispersion values where two stars overlap are lower than those of stand-alone bright stars. The background has a wide range of dispersion values due to the low number of photons in each bin.
