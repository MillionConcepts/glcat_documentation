# GLCat Introduction



GLCat largely abandons the "survey" type designations of the original missing planning system (e.g. MIS, AIS, CAI). We have tried to reprocess the data so that it can all be treated more-or-less the same across visits. The most important difference should always be the _exposure time_. In general---with exceptions outlined later in documentation---we refer to visits that are relatively long (>1000s) as MIS-like and visits that are relatively short (<200s) as AIS-like. The following heuristics (generally) also apply:
* Petal-pattern observations are integrated as contiguous eclipses across all petals / legs. This makes them MIS-like.
* Calibration mode (CAI) observations with large jumbs between legs are split into individual visits. These are AIS-like.
