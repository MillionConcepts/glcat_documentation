# Detector Flat Artifacts 

## MCP Detector Structure 

Talk more about this? Or just point to the multitude of papers on the subject?

## Mission Flats

The last set of GALEX mission flats are also used by gPhoton2. In both flats you can see recurrent hot and cold spots, as well as low and high sensitivity portions of the detectors. Many of the patterns reflected in the flats are a direct result of the NUV and FUV detectors. In general, they are not visible at the eclipse level.

The mission flats are 800 x 800 pixels, lower resolution than we can currently produce. The below image shows a higher resolution example of the FUV detector flat. This higher resolution flat was made by stacking 2,500 dose images of random FUV eclipses.
