# Additional GALEX Documentation

### Technical Documentation produced by the GALEX team

[This set of technical documentation](http://www.galex.caltech.edu/researcher/techdocs.html) hosted at Caltech provides a very good high-level overview of the GALEX mission and its pipeline products and data processing methods.

### GR6/GR7 data deliveries at MAST

[This directory tree at MAST](https://galex.stsci.edu/data/) contains the GR6 and GR7 data deliveries for GALEX. These are the output files from the mission pipeline, including intermediate files, pipeline logs, and QA logs and images. The data are organized by "GALEX Tile ID" designations e.g. `52168-GROTH_00_css10031` and can therefore be somewhat confusing to navigate for people who are used to the gPhoton eclipse-based organization.
