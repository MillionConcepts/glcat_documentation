eclipse
: One period of active observation for GALEX.  Because GALEX was
  designed to observe very faint stars and galaxies, it could only
  collect data while it was within Earth’s shadow, shielded from the
  Sun’s glare.  This occurred once per orbit, for about 30 minutes;
  therefore, the maximum duration of a single observation is about 30
  minutes.  Eclipses are numbered; eclipse 580, for example, refers to
  the period of eclipse during the satellite’s 580th orbit, or to the
  data collected during that eclipse.

leg
: A subdivision of an {term}`eclipse`, during which the telescope was
  observing a specific area of the sky.  There are typically 1 to 12
  legs per eclipse.

observation mode
: The general type of observation carried out during an
  {term}`eclipse`.  See [](galex_observation_modes.md).

plan type
: Synonym for {term}`observation mode`.

dead time
: The fraction of total observation time that is lost to detector readout.

depth
: The time over which incoming photons were integrated to produce an
  image.  Sometimes expressed as a duration, and sometimes as the AB
  magnitude of the faintest detectable source given that duration.

full-depth
: An exposure that was as long as it could be.  A “full-depth image”
  is integrated over the entire usable observation time for a
  {term}`leg`.  A “full-depth leg,” also known as a “full-depth
  eclipse,” is when the entire usable observation time for an eclipse
  was devoted to a single leg.

movie
: A time series of images produced by dividing an observation into
  contiguous periods of a specified {term}`depth`.
